# PiDay
- This was some code I wrote a while ago.... just some neat stuff with the digits of pi
- Based on an anaconda environment .... see imports section of notebook
- Updates comming to make the code easier to to export and use on other machines
- Note! some of the digit files containing pi were too large to include on git... best way to download the file from the provided source is 
using wget in terminal...
